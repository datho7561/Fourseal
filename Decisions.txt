IMPORTANT DECISIONS I'VE COME TO:

1. I'm going to prerender the background to prevent the CPU from melting my legs.

2. I have a global constants file oh goodie woohoo!!!!

3. Single player demo idea: tower defence with enemies with basic AI that come
    from outside of map and move to center, attacking the tower. Must keep tower
    alive for a set amount of time to win. Enemy spawn rate increases as game
    progresses

4. Create a temporary character select screen for the startup of the game

5. Minimalist appearance for the swords (basically a coloured stick), longer
    sticks for greater range
